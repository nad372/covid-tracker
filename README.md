# covid-tracker
Currently, the Tanzanian Health Ministry does not have a way to track citizens with covid. The ministry will start public testing, but need a database to store information on invdiduals who are tested and their test results. Test results are valid for 2 weeks and individuals will need to be re-tested on expirty after two weeks.


The database needs to store primary information on civilians, test results, covid certificates. 
The application needs to support a User Interface where government officials can input test results and register civilians.
Data needs to be encrypted.
